<Whack-A-Tag>

As simple of a game I thought this was going to be in the beginning, I think I
found a way to purposely make it a bit more challenging for myself.
Other versions of whack a mole games I came across, all used image assets for
some aspects of the game but I decided to keep myself from using any without
making the visuals compeletly bland.
Bootstrap helped with style and GSAP with smoother animations.
Some things I didn't have time to fully implement was a portion of raining tags
from the top of the screen to add a little more chaos and make a top 5 score board
as opposed to just the single previous. Also my first intention
for the background was to have multiple clone marquee text much smaller going
in opposite directions and turned 45Â°.
